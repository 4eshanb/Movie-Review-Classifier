Given the text of a movie review, multiple classifiers are used to know whether it is expressing a positive or
a negative opinion about a movie.

\> 5 out of 10) and 250 that have been given a negative rating (an overall score < 5). 
These reviews havebeen split into training, development, and testing files. 

Each dataset contains a list of reviews. Each review has two facets, Overall, which specifies whether the
review is positive or negative, based on the score from 1-10 and Text, which gives the textual review. Each
review is separated by a period character (.)
